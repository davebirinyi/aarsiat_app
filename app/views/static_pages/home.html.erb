        We are excited to spend the weekend at Wellspring Spa with our families and friends celebrating love, good food, the outdoors and a little spark of fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will begin the weekend with a welcome dinner <time datetime="2017-07-07 18:00">Friday night</time> to which all are invited. <time datetime="2017-07-08 07:00">Saturday morning</time> will be a wonderful time to start the day enjoying yoga in the Tom Tom Yurt.

        You can then enjoy all that Mt. Rainier has to offer taking in the beauty of the outdoors that we love so. Or book a massage at the Spa. We’ll start the festivities at <time datetime="2017-07-08 16:30">4:30pm</time> with a pre-ceremony snack and drink. After the ceremony in the forest Sanctuary we’ll have a <time datetime="2017-07-08 17:30">cocktail hour</time>, then <time datetime="2017-07-08 18:30">family style dinner</time>. Cake, drinks and of course s’mores will be shared to continue the fun.

    Wellspring Spa has a variety of things to do on site. There are a couple saunas and hot tubs available to soak or bake in, and a labyrinth to wander and meditate in. Ryan’s friend Emily will be teaching yoga in the Tom Tom Yurt on Saturday morning at <time datetime="2017-07-08 07:00">7am</time> and <time datetime="2017-07-08 10:00">10am</time>. If you would like to book yourself a massage please call Wellspring at 
  </p>
  <p>
    Mt. Rainier is just next door and offers many things to see and do. There are trails all over the park from short child friendly ones, to longer multi-day treks. Longmire and Paradise are also two beautiful lodges on the south side of the park. http://visitrainier.com

    <h2 class="section_header">Venue</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    Wellspring Spa sits just outside Mt. Rainier National Park. It is a wonderful and somewhat remote space that highlights the beauty of Washington's forests. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are some things to know about where we’ll be saying “I do:”
  </p>
  <p>
    There are woodland trails around the entire property. The trails are dirt and have roots and rocks that stick up. There isn’t much elevation gain across the property but there is a ⅓ mile “hike” from the Gazebo; the site of the pre-ceremony drinks to the Sanctuary where the ceremony will take place. We will also be having the reception on a lawn. Please plan ahead when choosing your footwear! 
  </p>
  <p>
    As with any location in Washington there is always the chance of rain.  Also, being out in the woods means it most likely will cool off in the evening (mid 40s). We suggest coming prepared with several layers to change into. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Wellspring Spa is remote, there is very limited, to no cell coverage. Do not plan on having access to your devices while at the property (or in Mt. Rainier National Park). There is a landline phone booth in Ashford if you need to place a call. 
  </p>
  <p>
    There are no pets or smoking allowed and fires are only in the designated ring in the Gazebo. Please help us maintain the beauty of the location by following a “leave no trace” policy.
